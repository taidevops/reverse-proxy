# Generating a status report

The `.\eng\Generate-StatusReport.ps1` script can be used to generate a comment for the status report issue.

The easiest way to use it is to run it from within the repository. You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). In this example, I've stored the token in a PowerShell variable `$GitHubToken`.

```
.\eng\Generate-StatusReport.ps1 -GitHubToken $GitHubToken -Clip
```

That will generate output like the following

```

The `-Clip` option means it will also put the status report itself in to your clipboard, for pasting and further editing. Fill in the freeform "What are we doing now?" section and post the comment!

Other options are available, and the script can be used from within any GitHub repo. Use `Get-Help .\eng\Generate-StatusReport.ps1 -Detailed` to get more help, including a list of parameters and their purpose.
