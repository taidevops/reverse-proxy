# Docs Folder

This folder contains:

* [Design Notes](designs/) - These are the design notes used to guide our development. They aren't designed to be usage guides but may help contributors in understanding why some patterns were used.
* [Operations](operations/) - These are operational docs for running releases and other infrastructure related to the project.
* [Public Usage Docs](docfx/) - This is a [docfx](https://dotnet.github.com/docfx) project that generates our public docs site [microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy). Any commit to `main` will trigger the [GitHub Action](../.github/workflows/docfx_build.yml) to rebuild the docs site and push it to the `gh-pages` branch.
